Integration between Moonraker and Home Assistant


A lot of Template sensors and rest sensors to have all the information I need from Moonraker (Klipper) on Home Assistant.
This way I can create a dashboard using HADashboard (AppDaemon) to monitoring my printer.

To have all this sensors available on your Home Assistant you just need to copy ```moonraker.yaml``` to your packages folder and make sure you update the IP address.


I'm using a [7" Touchscreen](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B07K32M4LJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) connected to a Raspberry Pi 4B.
I also design a case for this screen and it's available on [Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/touchscreen-7-case)
